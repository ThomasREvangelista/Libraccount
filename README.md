# Libraccount
A banking application for users of Facebook's Libra coin.

## Description
### What?

Libraccount is an application designed to act as a bank account for the cryptocurrency Libra, allowing for common users to unlock the power of the new cryptocurrency with the convenience and ease of a modern banking platform.

### Why?

Cryptocurrencies are not a new idea; Bitcoin has been in existence for well over a decade. The issues blocking blockchain cryptocurrencies from wide-spread adoption are three-fold; firstly, there needs to be wide-spread adoption of the currency, thus enabling it to be used as a currency. Secondly, the currency needs to be stable- like a currency- and not volatile- like an investment asset. Finally, it needs to be easily accessible and utilizable for average consumers. Libra is striving to fix all of the issues around usability and stability; We aim to solve the problem of inaccessibility for average consumers by providing a service that will allow users access to their Libra and transfer between accounts, much like they could with traditional currencies and banking applications.

### How?

Libraccount will be built on top of the Libra platform. Basic Libra smart contracts will be available in the app for use by the consumer as transfer-type options. A web app will be built for user to interact with the Libra network and their accounts, checking and displaying balances, allowing for transfers and smart contracts between users, and saving/displaying multiple saved accounts on the same page connected to the same user. The framework and tools we expect to use are:

Front End
* HTML, CSS (Bootstrap or Semantic UI)
* JavaScript, React/React Native

Back end
* Node.JS
* Web3.js
* Google’s Firebase

Tools
* Remix
* Visual Studio Code
* Git/GitHub

Miscellaneous
* Libra CLI

## Deliverables

1.	Web app
* Users may create encrypted accounts
* Users may store Libra wallet information for multiple wallets on the same encrypted account
* Users may switch between accounts
* Users may see their balances, including a “Net Worth” at the top.
* Users may transfer their funds between their own wallets and the wallets of others.
* Users may store the wallet addresses of past transactions to be able to quickly transfer Libra coins       to their peers without needing to type out long wallet addresses and risk typos.
* Users may enter into a limited number of present but potentially minimally adaptable smart contracts       using Libra.
2.	Mobile App
*	Add a mobile application to allow for the interaction with the user account(s) on a mobile platform;        it will provide all of the same features as the Web app.
3.	Backend
* Set of APIs to interact with the Libra network
   * transfer api
   * CheckBalance api
   * CreateContract api
4.	Libra smart contract(s) to be added to the application
5. Documentation and testing
*	Proposal
*	Design
*	Presentation
*	Final report

## Plan

1.	Week 1: Write proposal, setup team Github repo. Decide on set of deliverables for MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
2.	Week 2: Produce design document: frontend, backend, smart contract options, workflow
3.	Week 3: Write the smart contracts, create the frontend, and setup the backend
4.	Week 4: Implement backend and test the flow
5.	Week 5: Present the work to peers
6.	Week 6: Wrap up and deliver the final report. Celebrate by going out and cracking a cold one        with Dr. Pham at the Penguin!!!
